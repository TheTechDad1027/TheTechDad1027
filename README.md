# I'm TheTechDad1027

I build a constantly evolving ecosystem of utilities for power users. Tools are shared *as-is*, updated often, and expanding rapidly — innovation always in progress.

💡 What I'm all about

- **Build fast → improve constantly → share**
- Products designed for **clarity, independence, and large-screen usability**
- Passionate about automation with a focus on UI apps
- All personal projects sit under one growing ecosystem

🌐 Hosting & Discovery Hub

My GitHub is my **release and distribution engine** where:
- Apps live in public repositories
- Installable builds are versioned using **Releases**
- Each project includes discovery keywords for indexing
- Some tools also ship as offline-ready web dashboards

⚠️ Cover-My-butt Clause

Unless required by law or agreed to in writing, anything distributed here is:

> **“AS-IS”** without warranty or guaranteed outcomes.  
> These tools are experimental, evolving, and not 100% proven. Use at your own risk.
